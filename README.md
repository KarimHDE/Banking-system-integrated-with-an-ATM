# Banking System Integrated with an ATM (Student Project)

This project is a **student learning project** developed as part of my journey in studying **Computer Science**.

## üìå About This Project
This is not a real-world production system. It is a **practice project** that demonstrates my understanding of programming concepts, particularly:
- Functional programming (v1.0)
- Object-Oriented Programming (v2.0)

The project simulates a simple banking system with ATM functionality, including account management, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

## üìö Purpose
The main purpose of this project is:
- To apply what I have learned in class.
- To document my progress.
- To practice real-world scenarios in a simplified form.

## üß† What I‚Äôm Learning
I'm currently learning:
- **C# programming language**
- **Databases** and how to use them with C# (soon)
- **.NET technologies**, aiming to become a **Full Stack .NET Developer**
- Concepts like OOP, code structuring, and maintainability
- Version control using Git and GitHub
- Writing clean code and documentation

## üöÄ Releases
- **v1.0**: First version using functional programming.
- **v2.0**: Refactored into Object-Oriented Programming for better scalability and maintainability.
